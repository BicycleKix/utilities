IMAGES.py

I use this to process images when creating games. Sometimes it is useful for creating graphics for school, but not often.

PARSE_SPRITE_SHEET.py

My proudest code from my utilities. Automatically unpacks a sprite sheet as long as a few conditions are met from the inputted sprite sheet. Uses the pygame library to save them as surfaces.
I want to add functionality to save them as image files.

MATHSTUFFS.py

Ongoing math related functions. Anytime I have a function that I use more than once that has to do with algebra, vectors, etc, I want to add it to this.

STATS.py

For game development, just to convert json file saves to arrays to save stats and info for games. I am exploring the functionality for saving user info for custom characters in a game.
